Introduction

Cashierless shop is an app-based system which integrates with hardware and online
server. With the help of the app, the user can buy any product existing in the shop. Hardware
part manages all the product prices on the point and generates a QR code regarding the price
tag and quantity of the product. A user scans the QR code and continues the buying process.
This project put a stop to shoplift. A double scanning feature doesn’t let a shoplifter steal
from the shop. The door remains close if the shoplifter wants to do so.
Android app is the main point of this project. Android studio is the official IDE of
building an android app. The server is used for this project is Firebase. Firebase is certified
and owned by Google and firebase is very reliable. Firebase provides a very strong security
for the developer as well as for the user. Java language is used for the backend of the app.
All kind of coding and logic is implemented with java. For the hardware, part raspberry
pi is being used along with RFID Scanner, RFID Card and Servo Motor. Here RFID card
resembles a product and the servo motor resembles a door. All the component keeps them-
selves updated with each other via Firebase before functioning. Firebase uses its encryption
to store the passowrd. When a user inputs his password to login then firebase matches with
the encrypted password and proceeds if the password matches. All the data of the user is
secured by the firebase. Other than admin and user no one is able to info which has been
kept secure. Admin has the right to delete or modify the user’s info and the details.
By implementing this project, employee costs is less for the reason that there is no
employee to serve the customer. User only enter the shop, buy the desired product and
leave the shop with satisfaction. Users can keep himself up to date about the purchase
which is in the history section. Users can enter a registered shop only with the help of the
app.
